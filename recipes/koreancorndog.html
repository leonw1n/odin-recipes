    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>Korean corn dogs are hot dogs, cheese, rice cakes, or fish cakes fried in a batter on a stick and dressed with sugar, ketchup, mustard, and/or mayo. They are a sweet & savory treat that can be made in a variety of different ways!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 beef franks or sausage, rice cake, fish cake, cheese</li>
        <li>4 to 8 slices cheese</li>
        <li>1 russet potato</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>3 cups water</li>
        <li>2 tbsp corn starch</li>
        <li>1/2 cup panko bread crumbs</li>
        <li>vegetable or canola oil for frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Make the batter:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add sugar and yeast to warm water and let it sit for a few minutes, or until the yeast has dissolved and becomes slightly foamy.</li>
        <li>In a large, shallow container, mix together 1 and 3/4 cups flour and 1/2 tsp salt. Then mix in the yeast/water mixture until smooth. I recommend allowing this to rise overnight in the refrigerator, but you can also just let it rise at room temp for 1 hour. Refer to the photo for the consistency we are looking for before allowing it to rise.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Skewer the hotdogs:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Skewer the hotdogs on wooden chopsticks, then wrap the cheese around and place it seam side down on a tray. Put in the freezer for 20-30 minutes to harden to it holds its shape.
            *It depends on the brand of cheese, but sometimes they are not very malleable and may crack when you try to roll them. I recommend letting them come to room temp before wrapping, or you can microwave them for a few seconds.</li>
        <li>Take the batter out of the fridge at this time, so that it can rise a little more while the hotdogs are in the freezer.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>For the potatoes (if using):</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Dice a potato into small cubes, then boil in 3 cups of water and 1 tsp coarse salt for 3-4 minutes.
            Note: the potatoes need to be small enough that they will cook through when fried for about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Rinse the potatoes in an ice bath then dry them with paper towels<li>
        <li>Add 1 tbsp corn starch to the potatoes and toss until well coated.
        </li>
        <li>Dip the partially frozen skewers into the batter using a twisting motion to wrap around the skewer. You may need to use your fingers to spread it more evenly.
            Note: You don't want the batter to be too thick or thin. You need enough for the potatoes to stick, but you also don't want too much breading.</li>
        <li>Roll the battered skewer into the potatoes, then pack in panko bread crumbs. You will need to use your hands to firmly press everything together.</li>
        <li>Carefully drop the corn dog into oil at 350 degrees Fahrenheit and fry for about 5 minutes in vegetable or canola oil.
        </li>
        <li>Remove from oil when it is golden brown and rest on a cooling rack </li>
        <li>Add your choice of condiments!</li>
    </ol>
